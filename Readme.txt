Goal of the this patch is to integrate real sonar healing mechanics to NT in a sensible way 
and fix small incompatibility issues the mods have (ie: ruptured lung doesnt go away with lung transplant).

(This won't be big mod, just niche but tasteful things to increase gameplay immersion
as real sonar medical feels wrong when combined with NT.)

Goals:
Add surgeries for manna extract and smart graft.
Neurotrauma from brain hemmorrage.
Organ damage from sonar.
Config.



All development help is appreciated.
